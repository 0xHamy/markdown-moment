# Overview
Dive into the world of cyber threat intelligence with this hands-on, 74-hour course designed to transform you into a proactive threat hunter. *Cyber Threat Intelligence - From Forums to Frontlines* guides intermediate learners through building a complete intelligence pipeline, from scraping data on simulated hacking forums (clearnet, TOR, and I2P) to leveraging AI for threat detection and delivering real-time alerts.  

### What You’ll Learn  
- **Web Scraping & Anonymity:** Master scraping techniques using tools like BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and Playwright, while staying stealthy with proxies, IP rotation, and captcha bypass methods.  
- **AI & Machine Learning:** Fine-tune lightweight LLMs (e.g., DistilBERT) to detect threat patterns, such as initial access sales, and translate multilingual forum posts using DeepL.  
- **Data Analysis & Categorization:** Scrape, categorize, and store forum data (posts, comments, usernames) in a PostgreSQL database, using regex and ML for efficient threat prioritization.  
- **Web Interface Development:** Build a FastAPI-based web app to visualize and manage threat data, with background tasks handled by Celery.  
- **Threat Intelligence Gathering:** Identify and report breaches, with a focus on protecting Canadian businesses, by cross-referencing forum leaks with mock business data.  
- **Watchlists & Alerts:** Create a threat actor watchlist, cross-reference activities across forums, and set up real-time email (and optional SMS) alerts for critical threats.  


### Course Structure  
Across eight modules, you’ll progress from foundational concepts to advanced applications:  
1. **Module 1: Laying the Groundwork (10 hours):** Understand threat intelligence, AI basics, and web scraping. Scrape a simulated forum post while navigating anti-scraping defenses.  
2. **Module 2: Building the Web Interface (12 hours):** Develop a FastAPI web app with a PostgreSQL backend to display scraped data.  
3. **Module 3: Building the Data Scraper (20 hours):** Create a stealthy scraper with proxy rotation, tiered scanning, and error resilience to collect and categorize forum data.  
4. **Module 4: Fine-Tuning an LLM (10 hours):** Train an LLM to flag threats and translate multilingual posts for actionable insights.  
5. **Module 5: Cyber Threat Intelligence Gathering (8 hours):** Scrape, analyze, and report simulated Canadian business breaches using automated templates and email.  
6. **Module 6: Intelligence Watchlists (6 hours):** Build a database to track threat actors and cross-reference their activities across forums.  
7. **Module 7: Custom Alert System (6 hours):** Set up real-time email (and optional SMS) alerts for prioritized threats.  
8. **Module 8: Conclusion & Next Steps (2 hours):** Recap your journey, explore real-world applications, and earn a “Cyber Mounties Threat Hunter” badge.
